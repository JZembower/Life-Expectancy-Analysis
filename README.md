# Life-Expectancy-Analysis
Looking at the predictability of life expectancy of 183 countries related to various variables from data collected at WHO. Used multiple linear regression techniques for the predictability of various variables in life expectancy. The analysis was categorized into one year, 2015, first. Also, I did a total data analysis of 2000-2015 data.
